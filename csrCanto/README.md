# $csrCANTO token

$csrCANTO is a wrapped token, similar to $WCANTO, with the exception of being registered to the [Turnstile](https://docs.canto.io/evm-development/contract-secured-revenue) contract and the use of a accounting and distribution mechanisms to award CSR accrued to tokenholders.

## Description

The main purpose of CsrCanto is to be able to issue an ERC-20 standard wrapped $CANTO that would leverage the Contract Secured Revenue mechanism in order to distribute a portion of the gas fees spent by the network to the token holders.
All logic is entirely on-chain for transparency and security in order to function as a public good within the ecosystem


We have tailored ideas from 3 different ERCs to the Turnstile contract mechanism for CSR distribution:

1. [ERC-1726: Dividend-Paying Token Standard](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1726)

2. [ERC-1843 - Claims Token Standard](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1843)

Based on the same principles than ERC-1726, but with a different naming system. The _Calculation of the available funds_ and the _Example_ sections have been used to tune the automated tests for our CSR friendly implementation ðŸ™‚

3. [ERC-2222 - Funds Distribution Standard](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/2222)

> This EIP is based on and supercedes EIP1726 and EIP1843.
